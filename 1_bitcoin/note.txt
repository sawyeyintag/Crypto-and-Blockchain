# By default Bitcoin Daemon downloads Blockchian from 'main' net,
 and stored the Blockchian at:
	C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\blocksnet
Bitcoin Daemon opens ports:
 8333 for Blockchian protocol to communicate with peers.
 8332 for HTTP protocol to provide Blockchian services.   

# Bitcoin Clent:  C:\mycrypto\etc\Bitcoin\daemon
It allows using command line to connect to 127.0.0.1:8332.

Transaction services would not started until the entire Blockchian is downloaded.
But downloading 'main' net Blockchian takes unacceptable long.
